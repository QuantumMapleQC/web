    <h1>Why I Made This Website</h1>
    <p>For years, I’ve embraced Satanism—not the cartoonish, fear-mongering version most people cling to, but a philosophy of critical thinking, individual freedom, and self-empowerment. Let’s be real: this isn’t about chaos or destruction—it’s about breaking free from oppressive norms and seeking knowledge beyond the spoon-fed traditions that most blindly follow.

        I built this site because I’m sick of watching Christians—the self-proclaimed "moral authority"—act childish, hateful, and close-minded toward anything they don’t understand. This platform isn’t just a middle finger to ignorance; it’s a space for real discussion, free thought, and exposing the fear-driven nonsense that’s been pushed for too long.</p>

    <h2>Why HOA?</h2>
    <p>The <strong>HOA (Hall Of Autism)</strong> is based on awful people who are responsible for <strong>A LOT</strong> of bad things that are unfortunately Unforgivable or just too Fucked up!</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Grow a Community and get as much as possible exposing Fake Christians along with P3D0's (NO DOXING WILL BE PROVIDED ON THIS WEBSITE! THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE FOR EVERYBODY'S SECURITY!)</p>
